##CookBook

this dataset contains 81 column(feature) and 180 observation 

#Activity

it describes what was that person doing when the data was collected , it's of type factor with six
dieefferent levels described as below

1 WALKING
2 WALKING_UPSTAIRS
3 WALKING_DOWNSTAIRS
4 SITTING
5 STANDING
6 LAYING

#subject : 
It is an identifier of the subject who carried out the experiment, it's of type integer and takes 
values from 1 to 30.


#Measurement variables : 
The features selected for this dataset come from the accelerometer and gyroscope 3-axial raw signals tAcc-XYZ and tGyro-XYZ
These signals were used to estimate variables of the feature vector for each pattern:  
'-XYZ' is used to denote 3-axial signals in the X, Y and Z directions.
The set of variables that were estimated from these signals are: 
mean(): Mean value
std(): Standard deviation
